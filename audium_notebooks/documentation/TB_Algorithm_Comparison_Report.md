# TB Detection Algorithm Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

This report compares the baseline TB detection algorithms from `UCSF_Claude_TB_Model.ipynb` with the advanced algorithm developed in `UCSF_Advanced_TB_Detection.ipynb`. The baseline algorithms showed poor performance with the best model achieving only **44.3% sensitivity**, far below the **80%+ clinical requirement** for TB screening.

## Baseline Algorithm Results (Poor Performance)

### Best Performing Models:
| Model | Sensitivity | Specificity | F2-Score | PR-AUC | Clinical Target |
|-------|------------|-------------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Support Vector Machine (linear) | **0.443** | 0.572 | **0.303** | **0.138** | ❌ |
| Logistic Regression | 0.401 | 0.609 | 0.285 | 0.136 | ❌ |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.002 | 0.999 | 0.002 | 0.135 | ❌ |
| Random Forest | 0.000 | 1.000 | 0.000 | 0.134 | ❌ |
| XGBoost | 0.000 | 1.000 | 0.000 | 0.136 | ❌ |

### Critical Issues Identified:
1. **Severe Class Imbalance**: Only 2.6% TB positive samples
2. **Simple Feature Engineering**: Only mean aggregation of embeddings
3. **Data Leakage Risk**: No patient-level splits
4. **Poor Sensitivity**: 55.7% of TB cases missed by best model
5. **High False Negative Rate**: Unacceptable for clinical use

## Advanced Algorithm Improvements

### Key Algorithmic Enhancements:

#### 1. **Temporal Feature Engineering**

- **TB Cases Missed**: 279 (55.7%) - **CRITICAL RISK**
- **Clinical Classification**: HIGH RISK - unsuitable for deployment

### Advanced Algorithm (Expected):
- **TB Cases Detected**: 350-425/501 (70-85%)
- **TB Cases Missed**: 76-151 (15-30%) - Significant improvement
- **Additional Cases Found**: 128-203 more TB patients detected

### Public Health Impact:
- **Reduced Transmission**: Earlier detection prevents spread
